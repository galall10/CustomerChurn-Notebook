# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes **customer churn behavior** and explores patterns that help identify customers likely to leave a company.  
It demonstrates strong data-handling, exploratory analysis, and visualization skills using **Python**.

---

## Project Objectives
- Understand the factors contributing to customer churn.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset.  
- Visualize relationships between customer attributes and churn outcomes.  
- Build a foundation for future **predictive modeling** (classification tasks).

---

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** using the `kagglehub` library.  
It contains customer demographics, service usage, and churn indicators.

---

## Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Loading** – Import the dataset using KaggleHub.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values and data types.  
3. **Feature Exploration** – Examine patterns in churn vs non-churn customers.  
4. **Visualization** – Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical insights.  
5. **Insights** – Identify potential features influencing churn decisions.

---

## Key Insights
- **Tenure and Monthly Charges** show strong correlation with churn probability.  
- **Contract Type** significantly affects churn — month-to-month customers tend to leave more often.  
- **Internet Service and Tech Support** also influence retention rates.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **KaggleHub** – Dataset access
